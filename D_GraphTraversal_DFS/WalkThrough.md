Let's update the detailed step-by-step walkthrough to include nodes H and I.

### Visual Representation of the Graph

Let's visualize the graph we used in the code example:

```
    A
   / \
  B   C
 / \   \
D   E   F
   /   / \
  G   H   I
```

### Detailed Step-by-Step Walkthrough with Visualization

1. **Initialize**
   - Stack: [A]
   - Visited: {}
   - Output: []

2. **First Iteration**
   - Pop from stack: A
   - Check if A is visited: No
   - Add A to visited: {A}
   - Add A to output: [A]
   - Get neighbors of A: [B, C]
   - Push neighbors to stack: [B, C]

3. **Second Iteration**
   - Pop from stack: C
   - Check if C is visited: No
   - Add C to visited: {A, C}
   - Add C to output: [A, C]
   - Get neighbors of C: [A, F]
   - Push neighbors to stack: [B, F]

4. **Third Iteration**
   - Pop from stack: F
   - Check if F is visited: No
   - Add F to visited: {A, C, F}
   - Add F to output: [A, C, F]
   - Get neighbors of F: [C, H, I]
   - Push neighbors to stack: [B, H, I]

5. **Fourth Iteration**
   - Pop from stack: I
   - Check if I is visited: No
   - Add I to visited: {A, C, F, I}
   - Add I to output: [A, C, F, I]
   - Get neighbors of I: [F]
   - No new neighbors to push

6. **Fifth Iteration**
   - Pop from stack: H
   - Check if H is visited: No
   - Add H to visited: {A, C, F, I, H}
   - Add H to output: [A, C, F, I, H]
   - Get neighbors of H: [F]
   - No new neighbors to push

7. **Sixth Iteration**
   - Pop from stack: B
   - Check if B is visited: No
   - Add B to visited: {A, C, F, I, H, B}
   - Add B to output: [A, C, F, I, H, B]
   - Get neighbors of B: [A, D, E]
   - Push neighbors to stack: [D, E]

8. **Seventh Iteration**
   - Pop from stack: E
   - Check if E is visited: No
   - Add E to visited: {A, C, F, I, H, B, E}
   - Add E to output: [A, C, F, I, H, B, E]
   - Get neighbors of E: [B, G]
   - Push neighbors to stack: [D, G]

9. **Eighth Iteration**
   - Pop from stack: G
   - Check if G is visited: No
   - Add G to visited: {A, C, F, I, H, B, E, G}
   - Add G to output: [A, C, F, I, H, B, E, G]
   - Get neighbors of G: [E]
   - No new neighbors to push

10. **Ninth Iteration**
    - Pop from stack: D
    - Check if D is visited: No
    - Add D to visited: {A, C, F, I, H, B, E, G, D}
    - Add D to output: [A, C, F, I, H, B, E, G, D]
    - Get neighbors of D: [B]
    - No new neighbors to push

11. **End**
    - Stack is empty
    - Return output: [A, C, F, I, H, B, E, G, D]
