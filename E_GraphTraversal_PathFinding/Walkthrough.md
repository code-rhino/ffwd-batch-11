### Visual Representation of the Graph

Let's visualize the graph we used in the code example for finding a path between two nodes using DFS:

```
    A
   / \
  B   C
 / \   \
D   E   F
   /   / \
  G   H   I
```

### Detailed Step-by-Step Walkthrough for Finding a Path from A to I

1. **Initialize**
   - Stack: [A]
   - Visited: {}
   - Path: []

2. **First Iteration**
   - Pop from stack: A
   - Check if A is visited: No
   - Add A to visited: {A}
   - Add A to path: [A]
   - Check if A is goal (I): No
   - Get neighbors of A: [B, C]
   - Push neighbors to stack: [B, C]

3. **Second Iteration**
   - Pop from stack: C
   - Check if C is visited: No
   - Add C to visited: {A, C}
   - Add C to path: [A, C]
   - Check if C is goal (I): No
   - Get neighbors of C: [A, F]
   - Push neighbors to stack: [B, F]

4. **Third Iteration**
   - Pop from stack: F
   - Check if F is visited: No
   - Add F to visited: {A, C, F}
   - Add F to path: [A, C, F]
   - Check if F is goal (I): No
   - Get neighbors of F: [C, H, I]
   - Push neighbors to stack: [B, H, I]

5. **Fourth Iteration**
   - Pop from stack: I
   - Check if I is visited: No
   - Add I to visited: {A, C, F, I}
   - Add I to path: [A, C, F, I]
   - Check if I is goal (I): Yes
   - Goal found, return path: [A, C, F, I]

### Final Path Output

The path from A to I found by DFS is:
```
[A, C, F, I]
```
